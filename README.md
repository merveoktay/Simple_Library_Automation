# Simple_Library_Automation

In this project, the aim is to create a library automation system. A library file is created and book information is entered into this file. Then, reading through this file, operations such as finding or deleting the desired book are carried out. Additionally, all books in the file can be listed. The operation to be performed is determined by selecting from the menu displayed on the terminal.
